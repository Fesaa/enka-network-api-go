# enka-network-api-go
API wrapper for https://enka.network/ in go

# Requirements
I wrote it in go 1.21, will probably work with lower versions. idk
It's all very straightforward usage, some examples can be found in the [examples](./examples/) folder

# Instalation
```
go get github.com/Fesaa/enka-network-api-go
```

## Note
I stole the fields from the [java](https://github.com/kazuryyx/EnkaNetworkAPI) version :D
Feel free to message me on discord if needed `ameliahh`
